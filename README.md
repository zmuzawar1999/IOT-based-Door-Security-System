# IOT BASED DOOR SECURITY SYSTEM
Nowadays, there is a growing interest in smart and secured homes using the Internet of Things. One of the important aspects of the smart home system is the security capability which can simply lock and unlock the door or the gate. Since most of us are still using traditional keyed locks, we must always worry about losing the key or breaking into our house. With traditional locks, there is a higher risk of keys being misplaced or getting into the wrong hands. So, this project proposes a new security system using a password, OTP, Biometric, etc. In this system, one can gain authorized access by correctly entering the password and OTP or by using the authorized RFID card/tag or if it is an emergency then by using Biometric access via a mobile phone. It is also very cost- effective for daily use.
